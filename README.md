<h1>ALX AirBnB Clone</h1>

<h2>Description of the Project</h2>
The ALX AirBnB Clone is a project that aims to replicate the core functionalities of the popular vacation rental website, AirBnB. This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering program, where students learn and apply various software development concepts by building a simplified version of the AirBnB website.

The project is divided into several parts, each focusing on different aspects of web development:
<ul>
<li>Building a command-line interpreter to manage objects.</li>
<li>Creating and managing various classes representing the different entities of the application (users, places, reviews, etc.).</li>
<li>Implementing a storage system to save and retrieve objects.</li>
<li>Developing a web framework to create dynamic web pages.</li>
<li>Creating RESTful APIs to interact with the application.</li>
<li>Deploying the application using various tools and services.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Description of the Command Interpreter</h2>
The command interpreter is a crucial component of the ALX AirBnB Clone project. It allows users to interact with the application's data models through a simple command-line interface. The interpreter can create, retrieve, update, and delete objects, as well as perform various other operations.

<h3>How to Start It</h3>
To start the command interpreter, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Clone the repository to your local machine:<br>git clone https://github.com/KingDez04/AirBnB_clone.git</li>

<li>Navigate to the project directory:<br>cd AirBnB_clone</li>

<li>Make the console.py script executable (if not already):<br>chmod +x console.py</li>

<li>Run the command interpreter:<br>./console.py</li>
</ol>

<h3>How to Use It</h3>
Once the command interpreter is running, you can use various commands to manage the application's data. Here are some of the key commands:
<ul>
<li><strong>help <command></strong>: Displays help information for a specific command.</li>
<li><strong>create <class></strong>: Creates a new instance of a class.</li>
<li><strong>show <class> <id></strong>: Displays the details of an instance based on its class and ID.</li>
<li><strong>destroy <class> <id></strong>: Deletes an instance based on its class and ID.</li>
<li><strong>all [<class>]</strong>: Displays all instances, or all instances of a specific class.</li>
<li><strong>update <class> <id> <attribute name> <attribute value></strong>: Updates an attribute of an instance based on its class and ID.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Examples</h3>
Here are some examples of how to use the command interpreter:
<ul>
<li><strong>Create a new user</strong>:<br>(hbnb) create User</li>
<li><strong>Destroy a user</strong>:<br>(hbnb) destroy User 1234-5678-9101</li>
</ul>
